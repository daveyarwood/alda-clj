# Here, we do some postprocessing to improve the output of Garamond:
#
# 1. For some reason, Garamond intersperses a bunch of empty (whitespace-only)
#    lines into my pom.xml. This command removes them.
#
# 2. Garamond doesn't seem to have support for generating the <description> tag,
#    so I'm adding it in manually here (in an admittedly hacky way).
