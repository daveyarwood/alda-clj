A Clojure library for live-coding music with [Alda](https://alda.io).

## Background and rationale

See [History](https://cljdoc.org/d/io.djy/alda-clj/CURRENT/doc/readme/history)
for a long-winded account of the path that led to alda-clj.

## How does it work?

alda-clj is a Clojure DSL that is almost identical to the `alda.lisp` DSL built
into the runtime of Alda 1.x. But instead of being part of the process that
generates and plays the Alda score, **alda-clj generates a string of Alda code
and sends it to the `alda` client**.

The idea is simple: `alda` is just a low-level tool for playing a score that's
already been written (or generated). When you want to go higher-level and create
scores programmatically, you can do so in an external process and pipe the
result to `alda`. alda-clj is one way to do this.

alda-clj is intended to be used in at least two ways:

1. In an **improv / live-coding** setting, using a live Clojure REPL to generate
   and play music on the fly.

2. In a **music composition** setting, where the composition is a Clojure
   program / script that uses alda-clj to generate a score.

## Usage

1. If you haven't already, [install
Alda](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda#installation) and make sure `alda` is
available on your `PATH`.

  > alda-clj will shell out and use `alda` (wherever it's found on your `PATH`) to
  > play your scores. If desired, you can specify an alternate `alda` executable
  > by binding `alda.core/*alda-executable*` to something else, e.g.
  > `"/home/dave/Downloads/some-other-alda"`.


2. Add the latest release version of alda-clj to your dependencies:

  ```clojure
  ;; deps.edn
  io.djy/alda-clj {:mvn/version "X.X.X"}

  ;; lein/boot
  [io.djy/alda-clj "X.X.X"]
  ```

3. Require `alda.core` and you're off to the races!

  ```clojure
  (require '[alda.core :refer :all])

  (play!
    (part "piano")
    (for [notes [[:c :e :g] [:c :f :a] [:c :e :g]]]
      (apply chord (map #(note (pitch %)) notes))))
  ```

[Getting Started](https://cljdoc.org/d/io.djy/alda-clj/CURRENT/doc/getting-started) guide and
more are available at cljdoc.

There are also [example scripts](examples) in this repo that will give you a
sense of what you can do with alda-clj.
