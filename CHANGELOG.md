# CHANGELOG

## 0.1.6 (2019-01-21)

No change; bumped version to make some tweaks to documentation.

## 0.1.5 (2019-01-21)

* Bugfix: `cram` duration can be `nil` (i.e. the default duration) now.

* Emitted Alda code formatting improvement: instrument calls now go on a new
  line.

* Added a ton of docstrings! I'm not 100% sure the formatting is correct, so
  some parts might end up looking wonky. I don't really have a good way to test
  how the docs will look before I deploy them, and the docs are tied to
  releases, so I guess I'll just have to push additional releases if anything
  documentation-related needs fixing. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## 0.1.4 (2018-12-22)

No change; bumped version to update documentation via cljdoc.

## 0.1.3 (2018-12-21)

No change; bumped version while tinkering with cljdoc.

## 0.1.2 (2018-12-13)

* Bugfix: `(octave :up)` generates `>`, not `(octave :up)`

## 0.1.1 (2018-12-11)

No change; I had to bump the version while tinkering with deployment setup.

## 0.1.0 (2018-12-11)

Initial release. I think things are relatively stable, but report any issues you
may run into!
